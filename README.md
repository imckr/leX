# leX — A Lightweight Version Control System in C++

**leX** is a minimal, high-performance version control system built in C++ to handle efficient file tracking, staging, and snapshotting without external dependencies.

### Features
- Custom `.lex` object store
- SHA-1 based content hashing
- Blob creation and compression via zlib
- Staging area with an index file
- File status detection (modified, new, deleted)
- Recursive directory scanning
- Commit structure design in progress

### Why?
To learn how VCS stores objects, builds commits, and tracks file changes — by rebuilding it from scratch in C++.
